This package makes it easy to perform [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation) and [R-operator computations](http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/~barak/papers/nc-hessian.pdf). It is designed with Machine Learning (and particularly Neural Networks) in mind.
